    <h2>Frans Oudendorp</h2>
    <p>I have been active in IT since 2002 and therefore have several years of experience. Started as a system administrator in SMEs and then continued to a consultancy role. As a Technical Lead Secure, I'm working for Wortell. Wortell is a consultancy firm in the Netherlands and specializes in Microsoft's Security technology such as Enterprise Mobility + Security and Cloud & Data Center Management solutions such as Sentinel, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Security Graph, and other management and security solutions. My personal focus is on Enterprise Mobility, Windows 11, and Microsoft Azure (infrastructure) and I specialize in the Microsoft 365 Defender Suite - including Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office and Defender for Cloud Apps -, Azure Information Protection, and Identity Protection solutions.</p>
    <p>By sharing my knowledge of innovations and technologies as much as possible, I make sure that the customer can always stay ahead in the market. I also spread my expertise through social media and on this blog. In addition, I have been able to present at ExpertsLive and other events in recent years.</p>
    <p>Since 2022, I have been awarded as an MVP in Security by Microsoft. I am truly honored with this achievement.</p>
