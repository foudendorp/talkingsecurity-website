Listen to our latest podcast episode where we dive deep into the world of DevSecOps and its associated security challenges with David Trigano, a Senior Product Manager at Microsoft. We'll also explore how Defender for Cloud can assist organizations in gaining insight into their DevOps processes, and we'll explain how Defender for Cloud promotes collaboration between security and development teams by offering useful features like PR annotations. These features allow developers to quickly identify and fix any exposed issues. This proactive approach helps prevent security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations from making their way into the production stage.

Join us for an informative discussion that will empower your organization to embrace DevSecOps confidently, thanks to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
