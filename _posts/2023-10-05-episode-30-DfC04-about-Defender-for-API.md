APIs are everywhere. They are the backbone of modern applications, enabling data exchange, integration, and automation. But APIs also pose significant security risks, as they expose sensitive information and functionality to potential attackers.

In this episode of TalkingSecurity, we invited Ajinkya Gore, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft, to talk about the challenges and solutions for API security. Ajinkya is an expert in this field, having worked on various products and projects related to API management and protection.

We discussed the following topics with Ajinkya:
* What is an API and why is it important?
* What are the common threats and vulnerabilities that affect APIs?
* How does Microsoft Defender for API help you secure your APIs?
* And a little bit about the future for Microsoft Defender for API!
